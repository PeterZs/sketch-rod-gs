## Overview

Each dataset includes:
- COLMAP reconstruction data
- Pre-trained Gaussian Splatting (GS) data.

The essential dataset (4.8 GB) contains only the trained GS .ply files for quick visualization.

All scenes were captured using an iPhone 15 Pro.
Detailed information for each dataset is listed below.
